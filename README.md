# Diachronic-Frame-Semantics
A collection of scripts for working with FrameNet data and doing Frame Semantic annotation, specifically with diachronic language data.

Many of these scripts read or modify the data files available for download from the Berkeley FrameNet for English (https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/fndrupal/framenet_request_data) or from the ASFALDA FrameNet for French (http://asfalda.linguist.univ-paris-diderot.fr/frameIndex.xml).

Some of these scripts work with language data from a variety of French corpora. Information and links to the relevant corpora are provided in the documentation for each of these scripts.

All rights for these works belong to the respective projects.
